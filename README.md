#Music Diary

This was just a fun project to add something to my portfoloio while I try out projects 3
This project was something that I could see myself using so I created it 
It is a simple log that captures user input of a particular song stores in it a database and provides some analysis of the users listening habits
I hope to improve it as I learn new stuff 

some day I hope to refactor this into something that can use an API like spotify and capture the listeners habits that way instead of the user manually
entering each song
